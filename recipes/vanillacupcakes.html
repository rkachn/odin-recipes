    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe for vanilla cupcakes from BBC Good Food</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>110g butter, softened</li>
        <li>110g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>110g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line 12 holes in a shallow muffin tin with cupcake cases (not muffin cases). Cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat the eggs and vanilla in a jug, then beat into the butter mixture a little at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the flour into the mixture along with a little milk – the mixture should fall easily off a spoon. Divide the mixture between the cases, filling each one no more than half full.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the cakes for 12-15 mins – they should be firm to the touch and slightly golden brown. Cool in the tin for 5 mins, then lift them out gently and leave to cool completely.
